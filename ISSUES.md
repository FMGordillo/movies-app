# Hello :wave:

I will introduce here all the issues that I've found in the process.

## Which Node version should I use?

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

If I have a node version in my local that is different from the interviewer, it will have a staged file (`yarn.lock`).

<summary>Solution</summary>

I've decided to standarize Node version to **`15.14.0`** using `.nvmrc` and `.tool-versions`

See more here:

- [asdf-vm](http://asdf-vm.com/) (for `.tool-versions`)
- [asdf-nodejs](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs)  (for `.nvmrc`)
- [asdf-yarn](https://github.com/twuni/asdf-yarn)
